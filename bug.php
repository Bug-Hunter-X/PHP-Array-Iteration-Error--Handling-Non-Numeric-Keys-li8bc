This code suffers from a potential issue related to improper handling of array keys.  If the input array `$data` contains non-numeric keys, the `foreach` loop will iterate over them as strings, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors if the code relies on numeric indices.

```php
<?php
$data = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3];
foreach ($data as $key => $value) {
  // Accessing $key as an integer will cause problems
  $next_key = $key + 1;
  // ... further code that may depend on the key being an integer
}
?>
```
