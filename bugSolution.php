The solution involves checking the type of array keys before using them as integers. This improved version ensures that only numeric keys are treated as such, preventing potential errors.

```php
<?php
$data = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2, 'c' => 3, 0 => 4, 1 => 5];
foreach ($data as $key => $value) {
  if (is_numeric($key)) {
    $next_key = $key + 1;
    // ... Use $next_key as an integer
  } else {
    // Handle non-numeric keys appropriately
  }
}
?>
```
Alternatively, using `for` loop with `count()` can help if iteration order is important and you're certain to only have numeric keys.

```php
<?php
$data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for ($i = 0; $i < count($data); $i++) {
  // Access using integer index $i
}
?>
```
