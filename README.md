This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in PHP array iteration.  The `foreach` loop, while convenient, can lead to unexpected results if the array being iterated over contains non-numeric keys and the code relies on treating those keys as integers. The `bug.php` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version that robustly handles various key types.
